# Dex-Net 3.0: Computing Robust Robot Vacuum Suction Grasp Targets using a New Analytic Model and Deep Learning

Yes, another Dex-Net paper. :-) This one, I read, it's about extending the
previous system to handle suctioning. Pretty cool stuff! Have detailed notes on
the paper PDF, will port them here one of these days.

It would be cool to have the YuMi's arms decide among which of the suction or
the usual gripper to use. I think Jeff did that already...
