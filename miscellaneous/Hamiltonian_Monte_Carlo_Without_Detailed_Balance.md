# Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Without Detailed Balance

I used this paper more to get intuition on HMC rather than to think about their
research contribution, but it might be useful for me to dive into this later,
about how they can eliminate the rejection stage (which happens only due to
computer implementation). They have an interesting presentation based on moving
across a ladder and jumping among the two sides.
