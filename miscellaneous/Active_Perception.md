# Active Perception

This is an extremely old (1988!) high-level paper by Ruzena Bajcsy.

When I think of "Active Perception", I think of when a robot has sensors and
uses information from those to gain a better understanding of its environment.
The "active" part implies that the robot must *use* the sensors in some active
way, by performing exploration. (The use of sensors has gotten *much* more
common today, as exemplified by Thomas L. Friedman's book *Thank You For Being
Late*.) Indeed, in the *first sentence*  of the introduction, Bajcsy emphasizes
how perception should not be passive. The sensors themselves can collect
information passively, but they should be *used* in an active way. This is
basically how our eyes work; they don't modify our environment, but we *use*
then actively to look at important areas. Bajcsy views active perception as
"intelligent control theory" involving an agent that reasons and uses prior
knowledge.

This paper is a high-level paper, emphasizing the following points:

- **Example Task 2: 3-D Shape Parameterization**. TODO describe ...
