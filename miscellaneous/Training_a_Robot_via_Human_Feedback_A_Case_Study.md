# Training a Robot via Human Feedback: A Case Study

A pre-deep learning paper, where they build upon much of their own work to
train a robot via human feedback.

The system is described reasonably well, but I still have a hard time
understanding how it actually works.

It would be interesting to see how to extend this to Deep Learning. The author
seems to have found the start-up bug, but there is an interesting survey paper:

> Power to the People: The Role of Humans in Interactive Machine Learning

which I need to read!!
