# Eliciting Good Teaching From Humans for Machine Learners

Mostly a survey, I think, aimed at improving human teachers by providing
guidance on what they can do, etc. Some interesting points:

- Sometimes there are no examples to order/present to the student. So a teacher
  must generate them.

- For when a human has to help a classifier learn something, the concepts the
  human transmits vary a lot but the idea of an "informative sample" is
  constant among different concepts. Thus, teaching guidance only needs to be
  specified once.
