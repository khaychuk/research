# Core Knowledge

A highly cited survey paper in developmental psychology (almost 900 citations
as of today!) which argues that:

> Human cognition is founded, in part, on four systems for representing objects,
> actions, number, and space.

It's a bit dry, but much of it seems to match my intuition. The authors back up
their evidence by citing (for example) results which argue that for remote
Amazon tribes, they exhibit the same object-based cognition as other humans do,
even though in many other aspects they are different (hence, cognition based on
object representation is "universal" in some way).

I'm not totally sure what to take away from this paper, aside from trying to
pitch AI and robotics into this framework. ("We argue that a robot should do
task X and this is analogous to how human cognition is based on Y...") Like
that?

The paper also makes the claim that the human cognitive system is not based on
a "single learning system" or a "collection of special purpose mechanisms" but
rather based on these four systems of representation. Again, I don't really
know what to conclude from this, since this is not my research field.

Oh, another thing the paper argues: we're getting a fifth category here, that of
social partners and forming in-groups and out-groups. Ah, the identity politics
of humanity ... confirmed through cognitive science research!!

PS: this paper has a cool set of references. Steven Pinker, Stephen Hawking,
Lisa Randall, Geoff Hinton, David Rumelhardt, Charles Darwin, David Hume, John
Locke ... wow!
