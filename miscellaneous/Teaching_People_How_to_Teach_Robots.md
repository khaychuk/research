# Teaching People How to Teach Robots:

This is an HRI paper that focuses on the impact of stuff like videos,
instruction manuals, etc., to tell humans how to program a PR2 by demonstration.
(They also refer to that at LfD)

Some of their findings are a bit obvious, though, like that a video is helpful
(well, yes!).

I think I'll reference this paper and similar ones when I need to discuss how to
improve human teachers for robots.
