# The Jacobian Condition Number as a Dexterity Index in 6R Machining Robots

This paper is mostly unclear to me, but argues that we need to try and develop
smooth trajectories for robots, not just focus on start/finish (obviously!) and
understanding and evaluating the trajectories involves dexterity ... ? Yeah, I'm
not explaining it well. At least the review of matrices and condition numbers
makes sense.

They discuss the need for robots to be far from singularities. Sure, again,
makes sense. See *Modern Robotics* for a review.

Their example does not make total sense. Again, I am kind of confused.
