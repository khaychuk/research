# Analysis of Suture Manipulation Forces for Teleoperation with Force Feedback

One of the relatively older papers (2002) about force feedback in teleoperation
with robot surgery, with 127 citations (that's a lot!). As expected, the paper
argues that surgeons feel limited in their ability to perform tasks such as
suturing without haptic feedback.

This paper is about studying forces in different knot tying tasks. It's not
about a solution to force feedback; the last sentence of the abstract literally
states:

> These results indicate that resolved force feedback would improve
> robot-assisted performance during complex surgical tasks such as knot tying
> with fine suture.

All right, I guess there is a fair amount of follow-up work. This paper is an
empirical study which shows the relevance of this research area, and in fact
they say this problem was only described "anecdotally" so indeed, it is valuable
to get this quantified.

Three different ways to do the tying: by hand, by holding an instrument, and via
teleoperation (which is a 'fancier instrument' so to speak). I see. The
experiments involve analyzing the forces for these three settings.
