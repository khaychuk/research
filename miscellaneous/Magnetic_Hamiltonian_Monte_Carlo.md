# Magnetic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

I like the initial description and review of HMC, quite compact, and somewhat
makes it clearer why the proposal is symmetric, since it reduces to an absolute
value of a determinant of a Jacobian being there, which is 1 due to HMC
volume-preservation qualities. Unfortunately it cites a 1995 reference for that
filled with measure theory ...

The reason why it's called "magnetic" is because they're able to make the
connection to a magnetic field in physics.

Experiments are based on Gaussians, since this is mostly a theoretical work.

(I won't be able to go through this paper too much.)
