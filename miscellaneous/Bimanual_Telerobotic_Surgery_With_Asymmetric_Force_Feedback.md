# Bimanual Telerobotic Surgery With Asymmetric Force Feedback: a da vinci Surgical System Implementation

Another force-feedback paper, about trying to provide surgeons with what kind of
forces they should be experiencing if they were doing the surgery themselves by
direct touch (since the da vinci does not include force feedback).

The focus in this paper is on two handed tasks with forces from the action
hand's actions transferred to the reactive hand (the other hand). Hence the name
"asymmetric" here.

Yes, this makes sense. (Say, why don't these force feedback papers cite each
other more often ... there's a lot of related work and it's helpful to
understand their commonalities and differences.)

I am not sure how much we can expect to gain from treating forces as belonging
to an action hand versus a reaction hand...

(And then most of the paper is about designing the system, and then they report
some user studies. I can skip over these details.)
