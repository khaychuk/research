# ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural

This is the 2012 paper that started the enormous modern Deep Learning trend. In
the words of Professor Jitendra Malik, it caused the computer vision community
to embrace Deep Learning. I won't write a summary since I think I know it well.
For people new to the field, they might find it useful to re-implement the
architecture in TensorFlow.

[This excellent blog post][1] has a nice overview of the Deep Learning papers we
have to know about, and clearly this AlexNet paper is listed.
