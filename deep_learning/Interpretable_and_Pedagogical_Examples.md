# Interpretable and Pedagogical Examples

https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2018/04/30/i-and-p-examples/

A very interesting paper, showing that iterative teaching (by examples) among a
teacher and a student lets the student learn concepts quickly and which,
moreover, are *interpretable*. See examples from the corresponding blog post.

I found the experiments to be convincing as there was a wide variety of them.
The training procedure also makes sense to me, optimize student-teacher (which
are RNNs, btw) step by step.
