I'm not an NLP person so a bit hard for me to parse and digest. Looks pretty
impactful, though!

The problem domain is with summarization, but *abstractive*, so it's not just
picking and choosing sentences from the source and shrinking the number of
words. We actively need to get new words and describe higher-level concepts not
explicitly present within the original text.
