# Visualizing Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Using Natural Pre-Images

Think: does this make sense? Why does this work? Could I implement this?

Um ... unfortunately I didn't have much time to read this paper. The main
contribution is the "natural pre-image" concept, and then this paper goes
through several image visualization techniques, particularly to better
understand the features from CNNs.
