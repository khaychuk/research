# Population Based Training of Neural Networks

Nice paper on using a set of worker agents (or as I think of them, "students")
for better parameter and hyperparameter optimization, where the workers can
effectively copy the weights and hyperparameters of the best workers thus far.

I read this paper in detail --- might add some more hand-written notes here.
It's a good idea and simple enough that I could implement it without too much
difficulty.
