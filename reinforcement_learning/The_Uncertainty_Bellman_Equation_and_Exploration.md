# The Uncertainty Bellman Equation and Exploration

They look to measure uncertainty in the Bellman equation beyond the current time
step. Intuitively, this gives some idea as to the variance of the Bellman
optimality value.

They benchmark DQN, DQN Intrinsic Motivation, DQN UBE 1-step, and DQN UBE
n-step.

TODO: reread this in detail, along with (Tamar et al. 2016). Didn't quite get
as much as I wanted ...
