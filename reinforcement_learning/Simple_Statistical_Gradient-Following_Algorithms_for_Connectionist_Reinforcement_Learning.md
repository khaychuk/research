# Simple Statistical Gradient-Following Algorithms for Connectionist Reinforcement Learning

I skimmed this paper but don't really have much insight to add. The main thing I
know about it is that it's the paper we all cite for REINFORCE-based agents,
which is the same thing as saying "vanilla policy gradients." This was the
original paper that introduced that, though with somewhat hard-to-follow
notation. This paper also includes discussion on the baseline, which we use to
reduce gradient variance.
