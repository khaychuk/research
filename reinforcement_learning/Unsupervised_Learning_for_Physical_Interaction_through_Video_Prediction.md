# Unsupervised Learning for Physical Interaction through Video Prediction

I'm interested in this paper because:

- It's *unsupervised* learning
- It uses raw pixels
- It can apply to real robots

This paper is about *pushing objects*. I wonder if the same technique could
apply to (pinch) grasping.

I learned a new word: **advection**, "the horizontal flow of air, water, etc."
See: http://www.dictionary.com/browse/advection
