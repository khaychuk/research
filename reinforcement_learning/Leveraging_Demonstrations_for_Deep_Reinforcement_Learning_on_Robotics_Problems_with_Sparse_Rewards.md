# Leveraging Demonstrations for Deep Reinforcement Learning on Robotics Problems with Sparse Rewards

Very similar to DQfD, in that it combines an RL algorithm with demonstrations.
This time, DDPG is used with demos, whereas DQfD combines DQN with demos.

The experiments involve four simulations, then a real robot inserting a clip
into an object.

(TODO: more notes needed ...)
