# Neural Task Programming: Learning to Generalize Across Hierarchical Tasks

**What's the contribution?**

Proposes a meta-learning framework for hierarchical tasks in robotics, but which
uses a variant of Neural Programmer Interpreters. The idea is the NTP can take
in a demonstration as input (which could be just a raw image...) and then
outputs a policy. Thus, it outputs a *(task-)conditioned* policy.

**Why does it work?**

TODO

**Could I implement this?**

Not yet, I need to read this in more detail later.
