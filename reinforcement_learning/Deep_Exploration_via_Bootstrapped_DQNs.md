# Deep Exploration via Bootstrapped DQNs

TODO I read the paper, now need to figure out how the bootstrapping part works
better ...

(Because right now I think they just use an ensemble, so they effectively have
multiple DQNs with independent weights, though there's certainly lots of
variations with weight sharing.)
