# Terrain-Adaptive Locomotion Skills Using Deep Reinforcement Learning

An interesting paper which proposes a mixture of actor-critic experts
architecture for DeepRL in the context of continuous control for navigation over
different terrain types (for which experts specialize in). It's similar to Xue
Bin's other papers.

It looks like they pre-defined their terrain classes, I wonder how much
hard-coding is necessary.

(I didn't read too much in detail since I just wanted the high-level idea.)
